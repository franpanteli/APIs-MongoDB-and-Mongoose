# APIs-MongoDB-and-Mongoose
EDIT THIS ENTIRE THING
This repository contains my independent work for the second exercise in freeCodeCamp's [Back End Development and APIs](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/) course. This section of the course was called "Basic Node and Express", where I solved 12 JavaScript challenges by writing the myApp.js file for a project in a Gitpod environment. The problem-solving approach I used to solve these challenges is outlined in depth in [the project myApp.js file in this repository](https://github.com/franpanteli/APIs-Node-and-Express/blob/main/myApp.js). My notes on the material from this section of the course are contained in [the pdf file in this repository.](https://github.com/franpanteli/APIs-Node-and-Express/blob/main/Node%20and%20Express%20Course%20Notes.pdf) These are in-depth and cover the following topics with Node and Express:

<ul>
  <li>Install and Set Up Mongoose</li>
  <li>Create a Model</li>
  <li>Create and Save a Record of a Model</li>
  <li>Create Many Records with model.create()</li>
  <li>Use model.find() to Search Your Database</li>
  <li>Use model.findOne() to Return a Single Matching Document from Your Database</li>
  <li>Use model.findById() to Search Your Database By _id</li>
  <li>Perform Classic Updates by Running Find, Edit, then Save</li>
  <li>Perform New Updates on a Document Using model.findOneAndUpdate()</li>
  <li>Delete One Document Using model.findByIdAndRemove</li>
  <li>Delete Many Documents with model.remove()</li>
  <li>Chain Search Query Helpers to Narrow Search Results</li>
</ul>

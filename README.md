# APIs-MongoDB-and-Mongoose
This repository contains my independent work for the third exercise in freeCodeCamp's [Back End Development and APIs](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/) course. This section of the course was called "MongoDB and Mongoose", where I solved 12 JavaScript challenges by writing the [myApp.js file for a project](https://github.com/franpanteli/APIs-MongoDB-and-Mongoose/blob/main/myApp.js) in VSCode. The problem-solving approach I used to solve these challenges is outlined in depth in the project myApp.js file in this repository. My notes on the material from this section of the course are contained in [the pdf file in this repository.](https://github.com/franpanteli/APIs-Node-and-Express/blob/main/Node%20and%20Express%20Course%20Notes.pdf) These are in-depth and cover the following topics with Node and Express:

<ul>
  <li>Install and Set Up Mongoose</li>
  <li>Create a Model</li>
  <li>Create and Save a Record of a Model</li>
  <li>Create Many Records with model.create()</li>
  <li>Use model.find() to Search Your Database</li>
  <li>Use model.findOne() to Return a Single Matching Document from Your Database</li>
  <li>Use model.findById() to Search Your Database By _id</li>
  <li>Perform Classic Updates by Running Find, Edit, then Save</li>
  <li>Perform New Updates on a Document Using model.findOneAndUpdate()</li>
  <li>Delete One Document Using model.findByIdAndRemove</li>
  <li>Delete Many Documents with model.remove()</li>
  <li>Chain Search Query Helpers to Narrow Search Results</li>
</ul>
